    "Water exposed to atmospheric $CO_2$ traps part of it in solution. Increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been damped by the oceans, but at the same have resulted in an acidification that threatens marine ecosystems. \n",

    "Like seawater, rainwater also absorbs CO2. This leads to acidification. The pH of rainwater is governed by a series of chemical equilibria that can be summed in the following five equations with five unknowns:\n",
