    "He must decide on the number of stone clubs and stone axes to be produced for the upcoming battle against the neighboring Peaceful Sunset tribe. Experience has taught him that each club is good for, on the average, 0.45 kills and 0.65 maims, while each axe produces 0.70 kills and 0.35 maims. Production of a club requires 5.1 lb of stone and 2.1 man-hours of labor while an axe requires 3.2 lb of\n",

Ogâ€™s tribe has 240 lb of stone available for weapons production, and a total of 200 man-hours of labor available before the expected time of this battle (that Og is sure will end war for all time). Og values a kill as worth two maims in quantifying the damage inflicted on the enemy, and he wishes to produce that mix of weapons that will maximize damage.\n",
